Quick start tutorial

This tutorial guides you to start quickly with Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology for building confidential smart contracts.

## What You’ll Learn

In about 30 minutes, you'll go from a basic Solidity contract to a fully confidential one using FHEVM. Here's what you'll do:

- Set up your development environment
- Write a simple Solidity smart contract
- Convert it into an FHEVM-compatible confidential contract
- Test your FHEVM-compatible confidential contract

## Prerequisite

- A basic understanding of Solidity library and Ethereum.
